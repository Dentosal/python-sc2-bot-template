## Setup

You'll need Python 3.6 or newer.

Starting points:

- [Python SC2 API docs](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2), check out the Wiki!
- Your bot code goes to `bot/main.py`
- You can modify the `run_locally.py` starter script to your liking
- Do not modify `start_bot.py` which is used by the competition runner scripts
